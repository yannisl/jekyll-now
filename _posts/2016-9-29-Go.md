On this page you will find a summary of some of the repositories, I have been busy with. Nothing earth shuttering, mostly productivity related code.

## Go reminds me of Pascal

People might not like this, but old Pascal was such a convenient, fast, easy to learn and typed language that was a pleasure to code. Maybe a bit verbose and can look strange to modern developers, but had everything one needed to develop programs especially for students.
